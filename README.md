# Aletheia

_**Publish science for free, access science for free.**_

## Welcome

Thank you for checking out Aletheia. To find out what we are about and how you can fit into that, keep scrolling!

## What are we doing?

### The problem

A large percentage of scientific articles lie behind paywalls. That is to say, a large percentage of humanity’s collective knowledge is only accessible by those with financial means. The companies that operate these paywalls claim they only exist to cover their operating costs that allow scinece to be published, but the truth is these companies operate with a large profit margin. The fact that scientific research is not freely available to all stifiles innovation and humanity loses out overall.

#### The solution

We open science up. These paywall companies host scientific research and organise the peer review process, there's no reason why the community can't do that. In creating Aletheia, we are building a publishing platform that handles the peer review process for scientific articles that also doubles as a search engine, interating across a blockchain containing the records of articles published through Aletheia. Anyone can publish through us and have their work peer reviewed, for free, and anyone can access the entire Aletheia database, for free. 

## Who are we?

Aletheia was founded by two people, Kade and Roo. Kade sat down one day to watch _The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz_ and got really mad. He decided he was going to do something about the problems with academic publishing outlined in the film. He came up with the idea for a publishing platform that was run by a community, free for anyone to use and access. He spoke about his idea to Roo, the two decided to make the idea a reality, and how you're reading the README file in their GitHub.

Kade was accepted into Mozilla's Open Leadership program which supports the development of Aletheia.

## What do we need?

Anyone and everyone. Aletheia is currently under construction and we are seeking developers and designers. But just as software doesn’t write itself, communities don’t build themselves either, as we grow there will be further scope for contribution so check back regularly.
